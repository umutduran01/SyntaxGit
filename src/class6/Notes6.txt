git branch -a;
    We can use this code to see the available branches on remote repo. When we simply switch to the branch, it will be
    downloaded.

Merging on Local;
    Whenever we want to merge branches on main on local first:
        1) Switch to main branch,
        2) Then use "git merge branchName"

Merge Conflicts;
    This happens when two or more people work on the same file and edit the same line of code.

Types of Merging;
    1) Fast Forward Merge:
    2) Recursive/3way Merge:

Vim Editor;
    It is going to open up if there is no merge conflict. It will ask you to put a commit message for your merge commit.
    In order to insert:
        1) Esc then i
        2) Enter commit message
    In order to save and exit:
        1) Esc and then :wq
        2) Press enter

Git Ignore;
    If we do not want to push some specific folder, we cna use git ignore. To use it;
        1) Navigate the terminal,
        2) Start repo - git init
        3) Use command touch .gitignore
        4) Go to the file and "type fileName/"

        Mostly Mac users use it to not to have an issue with ds_store file.

Git Stash;
    We can undo the uncommitted code and save in memory. When needed we can bring back.
        1) git stash -m "message" - to undo
        2) git stash list - what undo's are in the memory
        3) git stash apply indexNumber - bring back
