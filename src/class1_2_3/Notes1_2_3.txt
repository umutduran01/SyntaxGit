Git workflow;
    1.	Open GitBash and navigate it to correct folder. The most correct folder to create a repository is project folder.
    2.	To check if the existing location, use pwd
    3.	To see what folders are in the existing folder, use ls
    4.	To create a new file, use mkdir “file name”
    5.	To open a folder in GitBash, use cd “file name”
    6.	To come to the previous file, use cd ..
    7.	To create a local repository, use git init
    8.	To add all files to stating, use git add .
    9.	To see the current status, use git status
    10.	To save the changes in repository, use git commit -m “message”
    11.	Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
    12.	To connect remote repository to local one, use git remote add origin URL
    13.	If a wrong repo is added, use git remote remove origin
    14.	To check if the remote repo is connected to local repo, use git remote -v
    15.	git branch -M main
    16.	To send files to remote repo for the first time, use git push -u origin main
    17.	To see previous commits, use git log
    18.	To clone a project from GitHub, use git clone “project link”
    19.	To receive updates of the cloned project, use git pull

After the first push we can use only git push in stead of git push -u origin main.
It is better to use git add . for all stating process. Stating is a temporary saving before the files are pushed to remote repo.
To see the existing GIT version, git --version is used.
